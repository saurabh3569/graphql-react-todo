# GraphQL React App

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack application using GraphQL with Apollo Server and React. The backend is built with Express.js and Apollo Server, while the frontend uses Apollo Client with React.

## Starting the Project

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

Once both servers are running, the backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/graphql`, and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000/`.
